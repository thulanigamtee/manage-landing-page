## My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- SwiperJS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was my first time using a library like SwiperJS, and I found it to be very helpful.

### Continued development

Don't like the way I wrote some of the code, though I have improved over time, I feel like I should try more ways to style a React app, rather than CSS/SCSS, and have I already made something with styled-components, and found it to be great but would rather stick with SCSS, my next stop would probably be tailwind css and it is something I have heard a lot about but never tried.

I also want to work on my folder structure, and try out the best practices as I recently tried dipping my fit into Angular and quiet liked it as it pretty much promotes the best practices, whereas with React everything goes.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://swiperjs.com/react) - Reading the documents made it a lot easier to get started with swiperjs, though I may have gotten some of the help from Youtube videos
